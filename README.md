prerequisites: Java 8+

**To run:**
clone the repository, open the folder and run (on *NIX machines) `./DrumSeq run`, or (on windows) `./DrumSeq.bat run`

in current state if you have no internet connection(but have all the dependencies already downloaded) you will need to run `./DrumSeq run --offline` instead

The src folder hierarchy has been kept to standard with processing guidelines.
